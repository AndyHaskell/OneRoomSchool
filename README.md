OneRoomSchool
=============

A JavaScript-based tutorial generator for making easy to read browser-based programming tutorials

Dependencies for this web app include:

-json2.js  
-jQuery (I used version 1.10.1)  
-Rangy's core file  
-Rangy's CSS Class Applier file  
-Underscore.js  
-Backbone.js  
-MathJax

The code from this tutorial generator is currently made to write programming tutorials with both
text and code pages in slide show format, which can be encoded in JSON by clicking the "Get JSON"
button.

The original OneRoomSchool tutorial generator was made to be simple so that it is easy to add on to.
If you want to add other features you think would be useful in programming tutorials or you have an
idea for an add-on for teaching specifically about Computer Science in a specific area of expertise,
feel free to add these features

Also, I would like to thank the programming community for all that the community has done to make it
easier for new programmers to learn new programming skills.  This tradition is what inspired me to
start this project.  Keep being awesome!
